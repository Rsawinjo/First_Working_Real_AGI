## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- 8GB+ RAM recommended
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional but recommended for best performance)
- Internet connection for model downloads and research

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rsawinjo/First_Working_Real_AGI.git
cd First_Working_Real_AGI
```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### Troubleshooting

- **CUDA Issues**: If you encounter CUDA errors, the system will automatically fall back to CPU mode
- **Model Download**: First run may take time to download models (DialoGPT-small ~100MB)
- **Memory Issues**: Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` in `config/settings.py` if you have limited RAM
- **GPU Detection**: RTX 40-series GPUs are automatically detected and optimized

## Usage

### Basic Operation
1. **Launch**: Run `python main.py` to start the GUI
2. **Model Selection**: Choose from available models (DialoGPT-small/medium/large)
3. **Conversation**: Chat with the AI through the interface
4. **Autonomous Learning**: Enable AGI mode to watch self-directed learning
5. **Analytics**: Monitor learning progress and system metrics

### Advanced Features
- **Feedback Integration**: Rate responses as "good", "needs work", "interesting", or "perfect"
- **Topic Mastery**: System tracks 326+ mastered topics across domains
- **Web Research**: Autonomous research capabilities for knowledge expansion
- **Memory Systems**: Long-term and short-term memory consolidation
- **Self-Improvement**: Meta-cognitive analysis and strategy adjustment
