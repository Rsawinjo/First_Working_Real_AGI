# Advanced AI Self-Improvement System

A sophisticated Python-based AGI-like system that implements continual learning, knowledge accumulation, and self-enhancement capabilities through interaction with Large Language Models.

## Features

- **Intelligent GUI Interface**: Modern tkinter-based interface with conversation capabilities
- **Continual Learning Engine**: Real-time knowledge acquisition and retention
- **Knowledge Base System**: Vector database for storing and retrieving learned information
- **Self-Improvement Mechanisms**: Automated model enhancement through experience
- **Multi-Model Support**: Interface with various Hugging Face models
- **Memory Consolidation**: Long-term and short-term memory systems
- **Learning Analytics**: Performance tracking and improvement metrics
- **Research Integration**: Automatic web research and knowledge synthesis
- **Hierarchical Goal Generation**: Automatically generates connected learning goals when topics are completed
- **Feedback-Driven Learning**: User feedback influences goal prioritization and exploration direction
